# esp32-morse

**this is just a fun project**

If anyone has suggestions please feel free to open an issue.

I assume, that you have set up a proper 'platformio' environment and are able to flash your ESP32.

Simply paste main.c in your project and test it out (as always backup your previous data).

the base code contains a 'hello world' in morse-code

Remember that you have to set/choose the right pin and this only works with one pin. Future addons will be made for fun
